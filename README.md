hi, was curious how ransomwares worked, so i made a very basic one.
This requires spinning up a local server on port 8000 that will hold a private key and public key that will be used for the encryption
As it works right now, you will be asked to supply a password "SuperSecretPassword" and then whether you wish to encrypt a single file or directory.
Same thing goes for decrypting. Now.. this wont stop the program from encrypting *itself*. **so please, do not encrypt the directory you are in or any data you are willing to lose.**
